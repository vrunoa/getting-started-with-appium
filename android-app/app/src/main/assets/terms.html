        <h3>Privacy</h3>
        <p>At the conference, your badge will feature a unique code for you. Our sponsors may request your permission to scan your badge so they can get in touch with you after the conference. If you agree, the sponsor will receive the following information (if provided when registering your conference ticket): your name, email address, job role, company and your profile link. By allowing our sponsors to scan your badge, you are giving them permission to request this information from us. Please note, we will not give your details to our sponsors unless you approve the request.<br />
            Appium Conf is organised by AgileFAQs. By supplying your email address during the registration process we will contact you with important information regarding your order – e.g. purchase receipt or your conference badge. We will not share your data with third parties without your explicit consent.
